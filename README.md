# Finite-State-Machine-Test

Description of the project:
  This simulation lasts 7 days and comprises 5 event changes each day. The simulation involves four states: Clear, Cloudy, Raining, and Severe Weather. It starts at the Clear state and flows through each state in a sequence of Clear, Cloudy, Raining, and Severe Weather. The transitions between the states are based on a random number or coin flip,    which can be 0, 1, or 2. If the number is 0, the status moves to the left of the flow, if it's 1, the status remains the same, and if it's 2, the status moves to the right if possible. The simulation also involves events such as Getting Warmer, Getting Colder, Humidity is Increasing, and Wind is Increasing.
